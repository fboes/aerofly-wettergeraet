This is a sample Visual Studio 2017 solution to demonstrate
how to write an external DLL to interface with Aerofly FS 2.

Requirements:
 - You need Microsoft Visual Studio 2017
 - The DLL needs to be copied to the folder
   "Documents/Aerofly FS 2/external_dll/"
   The sample project should already do this.
